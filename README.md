# Parades Of Staines

Parades of Staines is an independent furniture store specialising in retailing bespoke 'made to order' high quality pieces and are 
particularly focused upon solutions which suit those with mobility restrictions such as the elderly.

its location, contact details and opening times. 

In 2020 NB Technical Services were commissioned to update this site with the specific aims of:
* Updating opening hours
* Modernising the site
* Making the site responsive across all device sizes
* Removing redundant or inaccurate content such as stocked brands 
* Including appropriate information on the businesses COVID response
